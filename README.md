# Corona Virus Recognition Using Chest X Ray (CXR) Images

One of the critical factors behind the rapid spread of COVID-19 
pandemic is a lengthy clinical testing time. 
The imaging tool, such as Chest X-ray (CXR), can speed up the 
identification process. Therefore, our objective is to develop an 
automated CAD system for the detection of COVID-19 samples from 
healthy and covid cases using CXR images.
